Learning Data Engineering with Azure: A Free Tools Roadmap

Introduction
Data Engineering is pivotal in extracting insights and value from data. Microsoft Azure offers a suite of tools that can help budding data engineers learn and apply their skills in a cloud environment. This roadmap will guide you through using Azure's free tier and other free resources to kickstart your data engineering journey.

Worth pointing out this is an Azure/Microsoft-based talk not covering AWS/GCP

Step 1: Data Pipeline and ETL Processes
Concepts to Learn: ETL processes, batch and real-time data processing.
Tools/Resources:
Azure Data Factory: Get hands-on with data integration service to create ETL and ELT pipelines using the free tier.
Anaconda: Spark - mount data
Stream Analytics: Experiment with real-time data stream processing.
Demo?

Step 2: Data Infrastructure and Cloud Services
Concepts to Learn: Data lakes, data warehouses, cloud services for data engineering.
Tools/Resources:
Azure Synapse Analytics: Dive into big data and analytics.
Azure Data Lake Storage: Explore data lake solutions with a hierarchical file system.

Step 3: Big Data Technologies
Concepts to Learn: Distributed computing concepts, big data analytics.
Tools/Resources:
Azure Databricks: Explore big data processing with a limited free tier.
HDInsight: Practice Hadoop and Spark on Azure (note: not free, but offers a low-cost option).

Step 4: Programming for Data Engineering
Concepts to Learn: Python for data manipulation and automation scripts.
Tools/Resources:
GitHub: 
Azure Notebooks: Practice Python in a cloud-based Jupyter notebook.
VS Code: Use this free IDE for Python development, with extensions for Azure.
